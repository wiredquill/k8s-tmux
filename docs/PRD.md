## k8s-tmux: Cloud-Native Development Environment

---

### **Product Overview**

**Product Name:** k8s-tmux  
**Version:** 0.1.24  
**Product Type:** Cloud-native containerized development environment  
**Target Platform:** Kubernetes clusters  

### **Executive Summary**

k8s-tmux is a comprehensive web-accessible development environment that combines terminal access, file management, and cloud-native tooling in a single containerized solution. Built on tmux for session persistence and deployed via Helm charts, it provides developers with a fully-featured workspace accessible from any device with a web browser.

### **Problem Statement**

Developers working in cloud-native environments face several challenges:
- **Environment Inconsistency**: Development environments vary across team members and deployment targets
- **Access Limitations**: Traditional development setups require specific local configurations and aren't easily accessible remotely
- **Tool Fragmentation**: Cloud-native development requires multiple specialized tools (kubectl, helm, k9s) that must be individually installed and maintained
- **Session Persistence**: Loss of work and context when development sessions are interrupted
- **Mobile Limitations**: Inability to perform development tasks on mobile devices

### **Product Vision**

To provide a unified, persistent, and universally accessible development environment that enables cloud-native development from any device, anywhere, with enterprise-grade persistence and security.
