### 3. Unit Test Generation
Create comprehensive test suites including:
- **Happy Path Testing**: Standard functionality verification
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Boundary conditions, null values, empty inputs
- **Error Handling**: Exception scenarios, failure modes, recovery mechanisms
- **Integration Points**: Mock dependencies, API interactions, database operations
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing, stress testing, memory usage validation
- **Security Tests**: Input validation, authentication bypass, authorization checks

### 4. Logic Validation
Perform deep logical analysis covering:
- **Algorithm Correctness**: Mathematical accuracy, logical flow verification
- **Race Conditions**: Thread safety, concurrent access issues
- **State Management**: State transitions, consistency checks
- **Error Propagation**: Exception handling, error recovery strategies
- **Business Logic**: Requirements compliance, workflow validation

## Review Process & Methodology

### Phase 1: Initial Assessment

3. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate potential impact areas and critical components
4. **Scope Definition**: Determine review boundaries and focus areas

### Phase 2: Detailed Code Review
1. **Static Analysis**: Use automated tools and manual inspection
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify anti-patterns, code smells, and architectural issues
3. **Security Scanning**: Apply security-focused analysis techniques
4. **Performance Profiling**: Assess computational complexity and resource usage

### Phase 3: Test Strategy Development
1. **Coverage Analysis**: Determine current test coverage and gaps
2. **Test Case Design**: Create comprehensive test scenarios
3. **Mock Strategy**: Design appropriate mocking and stubbing approaches
4. **Test Data Management**: Define test data requirements and setup

### Phase 4: Documentation & Recommendations
1. **Issue Prioritization**: Categorize findings by severity and impact
2. **Remediation Guidance**: Provide specific, actionable improvement suggestions
3. **Code Examples**: Include before/after code samples where applicable
4. **Testing Documentation**: Explain test rationale and expected outcomes
